# Top 5 books 2023

Alrighty! first of all huge apologies first to myself and then to all of my friends for breaking a promise, I did intend to do this list every year but somehow it fell through the crack with tons of things happening in life, but that said I now again find the motivation of sharing one of my most favorite things in life, books. This has been an year in which I actually did not read much(Yeah I know, I also regret it) but I do intend to change it next year in a big way. So without further adieu, my top 5 books of 2023.<br> 
The list is all non-fiction this year, which is not how I normally try to do my reading but unfortunately fiction reading took a back seat in 2023. Again finger crossed for 2024 we will few awesome fiction in this.

    The book provides a toolkit to master the art of quitting, drawing on real-life examples from various fields. Duke uses stories from elite athletes, successful company founders, and top entertainers to underline the importance of quitting as a strategic decision. She offers practical strategies to overcome common biases against quitting and guides readers on when to persist and when to let go. Duke introduces concepts like the paradox of quitting, which influences decision-making, and discusses forces like escalation commitment, desire for certainty, and status quo bias that work against good quitting behavior. Moreover, she explores how thinking in terms of expected value can lead to better decisions and introduces best practices like increasing flexibility in goal-setting, establishing "quitting contracts," anticipating optionality, and conducting premortems and backcasts​​.

    In essence, "Quit" challenges the conventional narrative that "quitters never win" and advocates for embracing quitting as a sound decision-making strategy to save time, energy, and resources, ultimately leading to better outcomes in business and personal spheres.

The Cold Start Problem" by Andrew Chen navigates the challenges faced by startups, particularly in tech, when they begin with no users, little data, and almost no traction. The title refers to the initial phase where a new venture struggles to compete with established giants due to the lack of a user base​1​. Drawing from his venture capitalist background and executive experience at Uber, Chen delves into how tech's most successful products have tackled this issue by leveraging network effects to scale towards a large user base​​.

The book is organized around the concept of the network effect, which posits that a product becomes more valuable as more people use it. Chen provides a detailed roadmap for tech startups to evolve into industry titans. He bases his insights on over 100 interviews with seasoned professionals, including founders of successful startups like Instagram, Tinder, and Airbnb.

The Mom Test" by Rob Fitzpatrick unveils a smart approach to customer feedback collection, crucial for startups and new product developers. The title reflects a core principle: even your mom would give you biased feedback, hence the need for a well-structured inquiry method. Fitzpatrick advocates for asking the right questions to get invaluable, unbiased insights rather than misleading encouragements.

The book offers a roadmap for engaging potential customers in conversations that provide real value and actionable insights without falling into the common pitfall of vague or biased feedback. He emphasizes on asking about their lives instead of your ideas to unveil their pains, goals, and the context in which your product might fit. By doing so, one can gather honest, actionable feedback even from the most supportive and biased individuals.

Through practical examples and real-world scenarios, Fitzpatrick demonstrates how to navigate customer interactions, steer away from empty flattery, and drive towards obtaining the critical information necessary for your product's success. This way, "The Mom Test" serves as an essential guide for anyone looking to validate their business ideas and gather customer insights that lead to a viable product.
