# Top Books 2020(A delayed review)

2020 was the year where the world was transformed for everyone as we all were pushed to the hilt by the pandemic. If there were any positives to be taken from this unforgettable year it was that we got lots of time for ourselves. In the deep darkness of 2020 I devoured lots of amazing books and below is a quick mention of few of them recognizing their role for maintaining sanity in my life.

## 1) Harry Potter(The complete collection Book 1-7)-by J.K.Rowling

Wow!I just cannot imagine how it took me so long to read this fantastic work of literature by JK.Rowling. As someone who loves to read this was one of those things where I was under the impression that "Alright I have seen the movies and I know the books can be different but I don't have time to read a children's book right now" but boy was I wrong. The books create an intricate and complex magical world where there are so many special characters with their amazing background stories, whether it is Lupin with being stuck to be a werewolf or the heartbreaking backstory of Albus Dumbledore. The books are designed to make you understand yourself and it does not matter whether you are a kid or someone reading on their deathbed you will gain a lot from spending time in the potterverse.

## 2) The Hidden Half: How the World Conceals Its Secrets-by Michael Blastland

The Hidden Half is one of the few books out there which makes you extremely uncomfortable about the state of decision making in the world. This book should be a must-read for all decision-makers or for that matter anyone who is under the assumption that randomness is random and does not impact their lives or work outcomes. The book can be a nightmare for scientists/engineers/policymakers if they are not open to a humbling experience as it exposes the brittle knowledge paradox we all live with.
For anyone wanting to get the most out of this book, I would suggest take your time and think through what the author is stating about how there is a huge amount that we don't know and will probably never know about the world. This does not mean we should stop making decisions or acting. The only takeaway is that we should be more humbled and conservative with the believes that we live by or act with, as most of our decisions have a very high possibility of not turning up as we want them to be due to the huge number of hidden factors which are not under our control.

## 3) The Three body problem-by Cixin Liu

If you are one of those who have had it with pop culturish science fiction books(space operas,game boy fantasies and platitudes in the same order) this is a book which will make you fall in love with science fiction again . The book was recommended to me by someone on Twitter and boy the book was outstanding. I won't go into any details to avoid any spoilers but the book has complex characterization with mind boggling meta science thinking.If you are looking to read something to make you think and question your existing believes this is it.

## 4)The order of time -by Carlo Rovelli

What is time?Is it just a sense of movement from an event to other ,is it a perception of change or is it something non existential which we have embedded into our lives to make sense of concepts which are unfathomable.

Carlo Rovelli in this exceptional book goes above and beyond all the above questions.He starts with answering or should I say questioning our believes around time being a concrete metric .Using examples from concepts like time dilation, gravitational wave theory and many more he tries to question if every person in the world might be perceiving time in the same way.He further moves into the evolution of the current concept of time. He moves from Aristotle's concept of time to Newtonian time to how Einstein perceived time in his seminal work of relativity/gravitational wave theory.

The book is simultaneously an exceptional science book and a study in philosophy of life .In addition to this its very much approachable for each and everyone of us.There are lots of key concepts that resonated with me a lot. One of them was that we are not in search of more energy in Life but lesser entropy" ,at first glance this message seems simple but if you think about it in detail it is so much true in every phase of life and universe.We don't care about having more energy but rather how fast that conserved energy is moving into disorder is what concerns us, this is true for bodily energy or for energy fuels or for what that matter whatever you might be able to conceptualize.Another message from the book that I loved and which I will try to paraphrase is that we as humans have a concept of time because of our viewpoint where we are so much away from where things happen(think Thermal or atomic level) that we are able to perceive a change in entropy ,if the human vision was more detailed the concept of change would be different and hence our perception of time.Again a very detailed and thoughtful concept ,there is nothing like time. It is a perception that's it.Change your viewpoint or observation window you are in a different time perception.

Overall, probably the best book on Physics that I have ever read,I am really fascinated by the author and will probably read more of his books.The order of time is on my re-read list as there are concepts that i probably still need to understand and derive happiness from in a better way.

## 5)Thinking in Systems: A Primer-by Donella H. Meadows, Diana Wright
![](https://joelhooks.com/static/5e47a69b45b35530ed1bde022fb67007/fdb4a/thinking-in-systems.png)

A really amazing intuitive guide to learn about how our life is influenced by complex systems. one of the mental tasks that I always struggle with is the development and continuous usage of good concrete systems to navigate the complex world we are living. Concepts like Goal of a system, Flow vs stock and delay in a system, and why it matters are relevant across fields and our daily objectives. The monologue around "Limits to Growth " was also really deep and important as whether it is our personal life or professional life we don't understand there are limits beyond which there is only destruction and anonymity. The author does a fantastic job of simplifying the core concepts of system theory for a wider audience. This is not a book for a cursory read, it is something you need to study, digest, and then apply to your world and then reevaluate. I will definitely be re-reading this amazing book.
