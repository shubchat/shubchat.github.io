# The real threat of AI and algorithms is not automation neither it is sentience

Artificial intelligence/Machine learning or any of the buzz words being thrown around today are popular for a reason.The impact that AI or machines have had in the recent decade or two is phenomenal to say the least.Look at the below examples:

## 1)AlphaGo defeats world Go champion

## 2)Stanford algorithm can diagnose pneumonia better than radiologists

![Radiologist Matthew Lungren, left, meets with graduate students Jeremy Irvin and Pranav Rajpurkar to discuss the results of detections made by the algorithm. A tool the researchers developed along with the algorithm produced these images, which are similar to heat maps and show the areas of the X-ray most indicative of pneumonia.* (Image credit: L.A.

3)**Arguably there are chat-bots now which are doing amazing in Turing tests** .Check out the below conversation between a judge([Charlie Moloney](undefined)) and a bot at [27th annual Loebner Prize](http://www.aisb.org.uk/events/loebner-prize), held in september 2017.Isn’t this almost human like?

4) **California has now allowed driver less cars to test on its roads without safety drivers**.(check out Google’s Waymo in action)

5) **AI is transforming the way we make art**.Check out the below image from Deep dream generator which enables users to use generative AI to produce amazing images

Now a glance at the above progress made by machine intelligence may make many run for cover expecting a future showdown between man and machine.The pop culture is abundant with debates,warnings and discussions about sentience AI or a world in which machines will develop a human like consciousness.Below is what most of the AI discussing hobbyists fear:

![:](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Oyq-voGhZdQN9Z7RT6xkhg.png)*:*

**The above thought or vision of machine sentience taking over the world is still a daydream .Most of the academic experimentations,tests and research have strong indications that machines are still a reflection of human intelligence.For example-Chatbots may have developed amazing human like conversation skills but it is still based on how a human decides to train .If machines ever take over the world it will be due to abuse of AI power by a section of humans.**

The next warning which is a more realistic warning is artificial intelligence or machines taking over the workforce and making a wide majority of todays jobs obsolete.

**This although true is not that different from any other paradigm shift that we have observed in the past due to rapid shift of technology**.If today we are on the verge of driver less cars making human drivers obsolete,in the past there have been similar jobs which have made other work forces adapt or perish due to advancement of technology.The dot com age in the early 90s made print media almost obsolete it did similar to the age old snail mail.Going further in the past, the Industrial revolution in 19th century made us move from hand production to machine supported production.To think of it, even that could have been labelled as machines taking over the workforce. It is more about evolving with technology and we developing the necessary skill sets to work in synergy with machines.

## **Then what is the real threat?**

Now,that we have discussed some pop culture specific bubbles let us look at some real issues of the age of machines which is already impacting us without much attention.As per me the real problems which are being overshadowed by whatever sells culture of media are:

**1)The filter bubble:**What is a filter bubble?The term coined by Eli Pariser almost a decade ago refers to an ecosystem of digital age in which the user gets trapped in the algorithmic information flow driven by his or her own activity history.For example-If someone decides to search for only science fiction movies on movie recommendation sites,read only science fiction books on amazon and read only science fiction related news online .There is a high probability that the information flow to that individual may get limited to the spectrum of science and sci-fi across all of these three domains(movies,books and news).So,mainly he is trapped in a vision chamber of his own actions and this chamber will become stronger and stronger as he views more of what he is catered.

**Why these are ominous signs for humanity ?**

Think of a world where everyone is tagged as one specific type and is forced to act in that specific type only (sounds Orwellian right?).But isn’t that what is happening in today’s world of fake news and thought manipulation.The naysayers of the impact of the filter bubble should have a look at how big role the online algorithms have played at the US presidency elections.A world where everyone is limited to certain domains of thoughts is a world where the risk of thought manipulation is higher than ever before.For a social scientist knowing all of the subjects have been tagged as some specific type will remain true to the type is much easier target of manipulation that people having diverge thoughts and deviating away from the path of manipulation. The current world of social media makes us more and more like minded decreasing our ability to think,discuss diverge point of views and hence more likely to fall for propagandas and thought change attacks.

**(Technologies such as social media) lets you go off with like-minded people, so you’re not mixing and sharing and understanding other points of view … It’s super important. It’s turned out to be more of a problem than I, or many others, would have expected.**

**— [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) 2017**

**2)Use of machine intelligence in war weapons**

“War what is it good for?”.Albert Einstein once said **“I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.”**This was specific to the times when atomic weapons were the biggest concern for humanity.In todays time if we allow further technological advancement in the form of AI based weapons or controls for WMD we may be looking for the time of stick and stones much earlier that what Einstein would have thought of.

**Why this is such a big concern?**

One of the biggest reasons why we are able to avoid some of biggest conflicts turning into full scaled war is human accountability.The decision makers with the big red switch at the top are accountable for millions of human lives at every juncture there are huge discussions thwarting any attempts of a full scale nuclear war and so far we have been able to do the right thing.There have been cases where we have come close to huge wars “Korean crisis” or “Cuba missile crisis” and have successfully evaded them due to the human consciousness victory.

Now think of the same boiling situations being governed by algorithm based machine who have pre-set decisions programmed and no possibility of alternative decision making based on human like emotional accountability.I would not even want to think of such a situation to ever rise.

So yeah if we don’t want to suffer a Nuclear holocaust.We need to be in control of the fire power.

So,yeah world is changing,technology is changing .We also need to evolve.But the time are different much more different than they ever have been.The metrics needed to judge a decision which may have been efficient in the past example profit,productivity,throughput may have to be replaced by other metrics like human thought impact,diversity etc.**We may have developed the machines but we also need to develop our own skill sets to live with them.**

Thanks for reading!Please feel free to leave behind comments ,All thoughts are open for discussions.
