# The Story of an unwanted Writer
The day is Friday,Yeah it is finally Friday I look at my watch and the Time is 12:30 AM another day passed where i did not put pen to Paper,Now when I look back it is more than a month since I was fired from being The Chief Editor of a weekly Magazine,The reason cited was that my Writing is too detailed for the Twitter handling,Blog reading generation and the need is for fresh Blood.Fresh Blood are you serious A writer is not someone who expires with Time ,the world demands a story which has the depth of dark blue sea instead what we are getting is shallowness of an inadequate glass of water.

A writer first writes for himself,then for people who are similar to him and then does not give a rat’s ass to others.If a writer is careful before putting words to paper he is not a writer,he is a diplomat who is using his words to please the crowd .Is being a writer easy?No,never whether you are a popular one or the one who thinks he can change the world by his thoughts, the world is a shitty place for you both.You either need to be a sell out who writes about what the crowd wants to read.Yeah!Even those mind numbing stories of Teenage Love,perfect family will do, you just need to cater to the majority which expects a small easy potboiler of a story.If you are a writer who wants to write about reality boy are you in for a tough time.For starters how do you know what is the reality.Reality in our world comes in various shades of Grey.The Truth is closer to fantasy and Lies look more real.Moreover no one wants a peak at the reality,we all want to be Lied to as we deep down believe the stark reality of life will shatter away all the pre-conceived notions of a happy and perfect world that we have.

It is time to be real,to be honest,to find the Truth. As Henry David Thoreau
said “Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me Truth” .

Be real,Yeah the real you .I know reality is difficult its not something that will help you to be popular or to be successful or to be great but the only thing it will do is it will please the Truth seeker within you which wants nothing from Life but a promise that its pursuits should be based on the believes that he has and not to be influenced by the biased social commentary.

As a writer you can only be called a writer if you are doing it for yourself .The below few words capture the emotions to the T

“when it is truly time,and if you have been chosen,

it will do it by itself and it will keep on doing it

until you die or it dies in you.there is no other way.

and there never was”

-Charles Bukowski
