# The Books which shaped me in 2019

The year 2019

In terms of reading, there is something different that happened in 2019. Compared to the last few years where I was reading ~50 books a year. For 2019 I decided I will not track the number of books I read but rather read for the love of reading. Most of my free time this year(Which I hardly had any) went towards reading work-related literature and blogs. Despite this, I managed to read some amazing books across a wide variety of topics which made my year much more fulfilling.

### The books that I normally love

The books which really stimulate me normally fall into either of the below three brackets:

* Deep scientific research into a very specific topic

* History of world, humans, civilization(but from a multi-disciplinary perspective)

* Human Behavioral studies with identified action points

* Any book where the author is not being gimmicky but is making an honest attempt to inform and teach

All the books that I have loved this year fall into at least into one of the above brackets. Hence, **presenting the books that I loved in 2019**.

### The One World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined by Salman Khan

An awesome book about the broken global education system and one man’s fight to mend it. Few pointers from the book that resonated with me and will make me come back to it are:

* The current education system was developed with a one size fits all approach if you are not an ideal student or are different from the majority the system does not care for you

* The one-way delivery of content of knowledge from teacher to student is sub-optimal and antiquated. We need mechanisms where there is a two-way interaction and learning via different mediums(audio, video, etc)

* There is no such thing as a math person or a science person. Every kid can learn any subject that interests her or him. The way of learning might be different and that is the challenge that the education system needs to cater to.

### Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown

I normally don’t like the so-called self-help books but this one I really loved. Few of the messages from the book that are worth highlighting:

* Happiness/success/excellence in life comes from doing less really well rather than doing more where each of the things you are being average

* Learn what is important in life(Health, family, what you love to work on) and eliminate everything else

* Protect the assets(Health, relationship, will power)

* Let go of temptation of trying different things to identify what works

* FOMO(fear of missing out) is not worth it, everyone misses out on something. You need to decide what you don’t want to miss out on

* Saying no to non-essentials-take courage. Act to be courageous

### Lost and Founder: The Mostly Awful, Sometimes Awesome Truth about Building a Tech Startup by Rand Fishkin

When I started listening to this book my expectations were that this would be another rant about the founder's journey. On how a startup founder succeeds despite all odds etc. But, Rand Fishkin in this book has done something which not many founders & experts are able to do , he reveals the heavily guarded behind the gimmicks we observe and read from other information sources. Some of the myths he bursts are:
-Being a founder of a start-up will not make you rich quickly
- Most of the times you can earn more working for a big firm than being a founder of a start-up
- Although we glorify the VC funding rounds, they are most of the time not in the interest of the founder
- An MVP may always not be a good idea, it depends upon where you are in terms of organization popularity and respect in the market
- A Consulting business has higher chances of success than a product firm, Although the margins are lower
- You can build your product business based on the learnings from your consulting business

## This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel Levitin

We all listen to music and love it, but we never think about how it impacts us at a physiological and psychological level. This book delves deep into how our reaction to music is based on our evolutionary and genetic responses. Some of the facts that are stated in the book are extremely intuitive and once you know them you would start observing your own responses to music. The book also delved deeper into how different genre of music is structured taking into account human psychological responses. Whether you are a musician or a music lover I would highly recommend this book.
